# Final Project

The **Map** class is the parent class of **AttackMap** and **DefenceMap**. It contains a two-dimensional array that represents either the attack or defense map. The number of columns and rows for the playing field are stored as `static const`, currently set to 12, since the project does not account for different dimensions; modifying them later will be straightforward.

The **Maps()** constructor initializes the array filled with empty spaces (' '), which will be populated during the game with characters representing ships, attack map markers such as X and O, or Y generated by the submarine. There is also an overloaded print operator to display the entire game matrix with some graphical enhancements.

The **DefenceMap** class inherits from **Map** and is responsible for the defense map. It implements all the necessary functions to insert, move, repair, delete, and manage the state of the ships.

The **AttackMap** class, also inheriting from **Map**, handles the attack map. Its functions allow writing X, O, or Y when the submarine detects ships. It also includes functions to remove all X, O, and Y markers from the map. These two classes do not handle user or computer input; instead, they perform the requested operations. The map control is managed by the **ControlMap** class and its two derived classes, **ControlAttack** and **ControlDefence**.

The **ControlMap** class is responsible for storing useful information for both map controls, such as the number of columns and rows, and implementing a validation function to check whether a coordinate is within the map boundaries.

**ControlDefence** is the controller for the defense map, providing all functions similar to **DefenceMap** for inserting, moving, repairing, deleting, and managing the state of the ships. However, in this case, it performs checks on the coordinates and the map to verify that the requested action can be carried out. If the checks pass, the command is forwarded to **DefenceMap**, which updates the map accordingly.

**ControlAttack** is the counterpart to **ControlDefence**, responsible for managing the attack map. Before calling the functions in **AttackMap**, it performs checks to ensure everything is correct, after which it modifies the map through the **AttackMap** class.

The **Pos** class manages the coordinates and has two constructors: one accepts a string, while the other takes two integers. Its purpose is to store the column and row values as two integers, making it easier to work with them without handling a string. The two variables are **Col** and **Row**; **Col** represents the column as a number, while **Row** represents the rows as characters. The **Pos** class can manage a character from A to Z, excluding J and K, as per the project specifications, converting it into an integer.
